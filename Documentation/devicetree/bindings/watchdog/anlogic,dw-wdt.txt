Anlogic Synopsys Designware Watchdog Timer

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "anlogic,dw-wdt"
- reg: Two registers need to be configured, the first is the position
       offset and length of the watchdog controller, and the second is the
       position offset and length of the top controller.
- interrupts: DW Watchdog pre-timeout interrupt.
- clocks: Watchdog timer reference clock.

DW APB Watchdog custom timer intervals - Timeout Period ranges (TOPs).
Each TOP is a number loaded into the watchdog counter at the moment of
the timer restart. The counter decrementing happens each tick of the
reference clock. Therefore the TOPs array is equivalent to an array of
the timer expiration intervals supported by the DW APB Watchdog. Note
DW APB Watchdog IP-core might be synthesized with fixed TOP values,
in which case this property is unnecessary with default TOPs utilized.

Example:

watchdog0:watchdog@f8410000 {
	compatible = "anlogic,dw-wdt";
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <2>;
	reg = <0x0 0xf8410000 0x0 0x100 0x0 0Xf8800168 0x0 0x20>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 26 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&WDT_CLK>;
	status = "disabled";
};
