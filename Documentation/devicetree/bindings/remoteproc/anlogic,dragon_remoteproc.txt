Anlogic remoteproc bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "anlogic,dragon_remoteproc"
- memory-region: phandle to the reserved memory node to be associated
                 with the remoteproc device. The reserved memory node
                 can be a CMA memory node.
- vring0: ipi irq number used for vring0 notification.
- vring1: ipi irq number used for vring1 notification.
Remoteproc is a framework that allows the ARM0 host processor(s) to load firmware into ARM1 cores, start the ARM1 cores, stop the ARM1 cores, and configure resources that the ARM1 might need during their execution.

Example:
	&soc {
		remoteproc0: remoteproc@0 {
			compatible = "anlogic,dragon_remoteproc";
			firmware = "firmware";
			vring0 = <15>;
			vring1 = <14>;
			memory-region = <&rproc_0_reserved>, <&vdev0vring0>, <&vdev0vring1>, <&vdev0buffer>;
		};
	};
