Anlogic  Design ethernet expander bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "anlogic,ethernetlite1.0"
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
- device_type: set to "network".(ethernet@1C0000000 node in example)
- device_type: set to "xxxphy".(phy@1 node in example)
- local-mac-address: MAC address assigned to this device
- phy-handle: Reference to a PHY node connected to this device


The Anlogic  Ethernet Subsystem implements a tri-mode (10/100 Mb/s) Ethernet MAC or a 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet MAC. This core supports the use of MII, RGMII, and 100BASE-X interfaces to connect a media access control (MAC) to a Physical-side interface (PHY) chip.

Example:
	axi_ethernetlite_1: ethernet@1C0000000 {
		compatible = "anlogic,ethernetlite1.0";
		device_type = "network";
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		local-mac-address = [E0 78 A3 00 00 05];
		phy-handle = <&pl_eth_phy0>;
		reg = <0x1 0xC0000000 0x0 0x10000>;
		mdio {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			pl_eth_phy0: phy@1 {
					device_type = "ethernet-phy";
					reg = <1>;
			} ;
		};
	};
