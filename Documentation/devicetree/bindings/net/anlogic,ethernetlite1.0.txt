Avionic Design N-bit GPIO expander bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "anlogic,ethernetlite1.0"
- reg:Offset and length of the register set for the device 
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
- device_type: set to "network".
- local-mac-address: MAC address assigned to this device
- phy-handle: Reference to a PHY node connected to this device

Example:
	axi_ethernetlite_1: ethernet@1C0000000 {
		compatible = "anlogic,ethernetlite1.0";
		device_type = "network";
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 82 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		local-mac-address = [E0 78 A3 00 00 05];
		phy-handle = <&pl_eth_phy0>;
		reg = <0x1 0xC0000000 0x0 0x10000>;
		mdio {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			pl_eth_phy0: phy@1 {
				device_type = "ethernet-phy";
				reg = <1>;
			} ;
		};
	};
