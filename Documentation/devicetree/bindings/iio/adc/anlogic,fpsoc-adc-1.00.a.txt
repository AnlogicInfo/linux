Anlogic adc  bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "anlogic,fpsoc-adc-1.00.a"
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.

The Anlogic System Monitor is an ADC that is found in the UltraScale and
UltraScale+ FPGAs from Anlogic. The System Monitor provides a DRP interface for
communication. 

Example:
	adc:adc@f840b000 {
		compatible = "anlogic,fpsoc-adc-1.00.a";
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		reg = <0x0 0xf840b000 0x0 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		resolution = <12>;
		anlogic,channels {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			channel@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				iomux = <16>;
			};
		};
	};
