Anlogic Design N-bit GPIO expander bindings

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "snps,dw-apb-anlogic-gpio"(gpio@f8411000 in example)
- compatible: should be "snps,dw-apb-gpio-port"(gpio-controller@0 in example)
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
- reg: Max Ports
- clocks: DW GPIO debounce reference clock source
- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.
- #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the
  second cell is used to specify optional parameters:
  - bit 0: polarity (0: normal, 1: inverted)
- gpio-controller: Marks the device as a GPIO controller.
- ngpios: The number of GPIO pins exported by the port.
- interrupts: The interrupts to the parent controller raised when GPIOs generate
              the interrupts. If the controller provides one combined interrupt
              for all GPIOs, specify a single interrupt. If the controller provides
              one interrupt for each GPIO, provide a list of interrupts that
              correspond to each of the GPIO pins.
- interrupt-controller : marks this as an interrupt controller

  Synopsys DesignWare GPIO controllers have a configurable number of ports,
  each of which are intended to be represented as child nodes with the generic
  GPIO-controller properties as desribed in this bindings file.

Example:

gpio: gpio@f8411000 {
	compatible = "snps,dw-apb-anlogic-gpio";
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	reg = <0x0 0xf8411000 0x0 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&GPIO_CLK>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	status = "okay";

	bank0: gpio-controller@0 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-gpio-port";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 52 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg = <0>;
		ngpios = <32>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	};
};
